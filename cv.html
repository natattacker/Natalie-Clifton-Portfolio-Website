    <p>As a graphic designer, I love being able to create designs that are fun and appealing while also keeping a professional 
      aspect. Growing up, I always had an interest in drawing and knew I wanted to work in a field that would allow me to design 
      things for others people. Art is my passion, and I would love to be able to use my skills to help others see their visions come 
      to life. While I am a graphic designer, I also have experience in charcoal drawing as well as a bit of web design. This very website 
      you are on was created by me! I am willing to continue to learn more about web design if you need someone who can create a website for your company.</p>
    
    <p>Ultimately, graphic design is what I have gone to school for, and it is my expertise. I can make posters, advertisements, labeling for products, and 
      much more. While I haven't had much experience creating designs specifically for clients yet, I have made a lot of designs for school. I wish to obtain 
      even more experience by using my skills in the work field, and I would like to be able to learn more hands-on about professionalism when it comes to designing 
      for clients.</p>

    <p>
      I am very excited to delve into the graphic design field, and I hope this website helps to give a clearer picture of the kind of work I do. I thank you for your consideration, 
      and if you have any questions, please see this website's contact page for more information on how to reach me!</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Natalie Clifton</p>
